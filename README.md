UltrakillTimer is a game modification developed for Risk of Rain 2 that replaces the escape countdown in Commencement with the **CRITICAL FAILURE** timer found in ULTRAKILL.

This mod is client-side and completely visual, and it is compatible with any mod that may change the escape countdown's duration.
